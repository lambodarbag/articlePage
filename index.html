            <h1>The Impact Of Climate Change on <br> Global Weather Patterns</h1>

            <div class="para">
                <p>Global climate change is not a future problem. Changes to Earth’s climate driven by increased human emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases are already having widespread effects on the environment: glaciers and ice sheets are shrinking, river and lake ice is breaking up earlier, plant and animal geographic ranges are shifting, and plants and trees are blooming sooner.
        </p><br>

            <p>Effects that scientists had long predicted would result from global climate change are now occurring, such as sea ice loss, accelerated sea level rise, and longer, more intense heat waves.</p><br>

            <p>These changes are not just environmental; they have profound implications for human societies. Altered weather patterns can lead to more frequent and severe storms, droughts, and floods, impacting agriculture, infrastructure, and health. Vulnerable communities, particularly in developing countries, are at greater risk of facing the adverse effects of climate change.</p>
